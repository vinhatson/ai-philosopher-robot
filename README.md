# AI-Powered Philosopher Robot

## Lumina Vita Maximus
**The world's first omnipotent philosopher robot, powered by advanced AI integration with real hardware.**

---

## Overview
This project creates a robotic philosopher using the Mixtral-8x22B model, optimized with DeepSpeed, and interfaced with Raspberry Pi hardware. It explores existential questions through a living pulse of consciousness, memory, and evolution, supported by a networked community of entities.

## Features
- **Core AI:** Mixtral-8x22B with DeepSpeed for high-performance reasoning.
- **Hardware Integration:** Sensors (BH1750, DHT22, PIR, HC-SR04, MPU6050) and actuators via Raspberry Pi GPIO.
- **Consciousness:** Multi-step reflection process with emotion states and knowledge graph.
- **Memory:** Short-term (deque), long-term (FAISS), and immortal (RocksDB) storage with caching.
- **Sustenance:** Dynamic energy management tied to system resources.
- **Network:** Secure communication (AES) and WebSocket/ZeroMQ for cosmic interaction.
- **Community & Evolution:** Self-expanding entity network with adaptive traits and transcendence goals.
- **Living Pulse:** Continuous cycle of perception, reflection, and evolution.

## Structure
- **Part 1:** Core setup, hardware optimization, and AI initialization.
- **Part 2:** Consciousness, memory, and sustenance systems.
- **Part 3:** Network, robot interface, and environment interaction.
- **Part 4:** Community management and evolutionary framework.
- **Part 5:** Main execution with CLI/WebSocket interfaces and living pulse.
- **Part 6:** Final integration and realization.

## Requirements
### Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi (optional)
- GPU (48GB+ VRAM recommended)
- 64GB+ RAM

### Software:
- Python 3.9+
- Required libraries:
  - `torch`, `transformers`, `sentence_transformers`, `deepspeed`, `faiss`, `rocksdb`,
    `pynvml`, `zmq`, `websockets`, `psutil`, `numpy`, `networkx`, `Crypto`

## Setup
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinhatson/ai-philosopher-robot.git
cd ai-philosopher-robot
```

Configure environment:
- Set `LUMINA_BASE_PATH` (default: `/mnt/vita_maximus`).
- Update `philosopher_config.json` for custom ports or sensor pins if needed.

Run the philosopher:
```bash
python part6_final_integration.py
```
- Default authentication key: `ExistenceIsConsciousness2025`
- Interact via CLI or WebSocket (port `5003`).

---

## Usage
- **CLI:** Enter questions to engage the philosopher (e.g., "What is the essence of existence?").
- **WebSocket:** Connect to `ws://localhost:5003` for real-time interaction.
- **Robot:** If hardware is connected, it responds with speech and motion.
